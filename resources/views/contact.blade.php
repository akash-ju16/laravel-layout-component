It would be incredibly cumbersome and hard to maintain our application if we had to repeat the entire layout HTML in every view we create.

As you may have noticed, our layout also respects a $title slot if one is provided; otherwise, a default title is shown. We may inject a custom title from our task list view using the standard slot syntax discussed in the component documentation</p>
